	/// An optional interface which can be implemented to give mods the ability to dynamically
	/// add new options at runtime, or to get a notification when options are updated to the
	/// options file.
	/// 
	/// This interface is <b>optional</b>. There is no need to implement it to use PLib
	/// Options. But if one method is implemented, the other must also be. If not used,
	/// OnOptionsChanged should be empty, and CreateOptions should return null or an empty
	/// collection.

		/// Called to create additional options. After the options in this class have been
		/// read from the data file, but before the dialog is shown, this method will be
		/// invoked. Each return value must be of a type that implements IDynamicOption.
		/// 
		/// The options will be sorted and categorized normally as if they were present at the
		/// end of the property list in a regular options class.
		/// 
		/// This method can be an enumerator using code like
		/// yield return new MyOptionsHandler();
		/// </summary>
		/// <returns>The custom options to implement.</returns>

		/// <summary>
		/// Called when options are written to the file. The current object will have the same
		/// values as the data that was just written to the file. This call happens after the
		/// options have been stored to disk, but before any restart required dialog is shown
		/// (if [RestartRequired] is also on this class).
